# sms-termii-dotnet
Cross-platform .NET C# Library for sending SMS via mobile, web apps, or desktop apps through Termii SMS provider

This is an open-source library that I contributed for end-users using .NET 6.0 or later to integrate with Termii (see https://developers.termii.com)

Termii provides SMS services that can reach even DND mobile numbers and the price is very friendly.
See: https://www.termii.com/pricing

To sign up on their platform, go to https://accounts.termii.com/#/register
